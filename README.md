# Unity Project Directory Template
Organization of a software project starts with its directory structure. Espacially in game development which contains different types of resources like scripts, models, audio files, sprites etc. organization of directories becomes an important part of development. I use this template for hyper-casual and casual mobile game projects.

## Directory Structure
* [Animations]()
* [Audio]()
* [Materials]()
* [Models]()
* [PhsyicMaterials]()
* [Prefabs]()
* [Resources]()
* [Scenes]()
* [Scripts]()
  * [Editor]()
* [Shaders]()
* [Sprites]()
* [Textures]()
* [ThirdParty]()

## Some Rules
* Keep naming rules consistent.
* Always use sub folders to save assets. Dont use the root. Create extra folder above if you really need special directory.
