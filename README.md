# Unity Project Directory Template
I use this directory template for hyper-casual and casual mobile game projects.

## Directory Structure
* [Animations]()
* [Audio]()
* [Materials]()
* [Models]()
* [PhsyicMaterials]()
* [Prefabs]()
* [Resources]()
* [Scenes]()
* [Scripts]()
  * [Editor]()
* [Shaders]()
* [Sprites]()
* [Textures]()
* [ThirdParty]()

**Tip 1** You must place Editor scripts in a folder called Editor for them to work correctly. So this is special folder that shouldn't changed.
**Tip 2** Unity lets you load assets in Resources folder via script. So this is also special folder that shouldn't changed. 

## Some Rules
* Keep naming rules consistent.
* Always use sub folders to save assets. Dont use the root. Create extra folder above if you really need special directory.
